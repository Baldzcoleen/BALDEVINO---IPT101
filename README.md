Personal Portfolio Website - Amabelle Coleen D. Baldevino

This project is a personal portfolio website developed by Amabelle Coleen D. Baldevino, a student of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. It was created as part of an academic requirement and as a means to present her skills, background, and interests in front-end development and UX/UI design. The website features a clean, responsive layout built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It incorporates modern web tools and libraries such as Boxicons, Font Awesome for icons, and Typed.js for a typing text animation effect. The site includes dedicated sections for an introduction, skills, portfolio projects, and contact information, along with visuals and social media links. This portfolio is not only a reflection of Amabelleâ€™s growing technical capabilities but also an expression of her creativity and career aspirations. The website is hosted using GitHub Pages and is intended for both academic and personal branding purposes.
